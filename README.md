Fundament
=========

Another base library for the OCaml language, with
continuation-passing-style iteratees, benchmarking, and pretty
printing.

Very much work in progress.

## Prerequisites

I use embedded records and (G)ADTs, so OCaml 4.03 will be needed (for
embedded records). Just do an opam switch to the latest (development)
version.
